from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create a database engine (this is just an example for a PostgreSQL database)
engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname')

# Write your SQL query
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM your_table"

# Fetch data directly into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql_query(sql_query, engine)

# View the DataFrame
print(df)




Key Points:
pandas.read_sql_query() is a convenient method to execute SQL queries directly and fetch the results into a DataFrame.
If you fetch data manually (e.g., using a cursor or fetching all results with fetchall()), you can manually convert it into a DataFrame by passing the data and column names to pd.DataFrame().
